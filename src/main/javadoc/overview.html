<b>FXGraphics2D</b> is a bridge from Java2D to JavaFX that translates Java2D 
calls (to the {@code Graphics2D} API) into the equivalent calls to the 
{@code GraphicsContext} of a JavaFX {@code Canvas}.  It has been developed
to provide JavaFX support in <a href="http://www.object-refinery.com/orsoncharts/">Orson Charts</a> 
and <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a>.
