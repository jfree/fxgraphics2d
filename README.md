[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.jfree/org.jfree.fxgraphics2d)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.jfree/org.jfree.fxgraphics2d/versions) [![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/org.jfree/org.jfree.fxgraphics2d/javadoc.svg)](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.jfree/org.jfree.fxgraphics2d) [![JFXCentral](https://img.shields.io/badge/Find_me_on-JFXCentral-blue?logo=googlechrome&logoColor=white)](https://www.jfx-central.com/libraries/fxgraphics2d)

Overview
--------
**FXGraphics2D** is an implementation of Java's `Graphics2D` API that targets the JavaFX `Canvas`.  It makes it 
possible to reuse existing Java2D code in a JavaFX application.  The following example is generated by [JFreeChart-FX](https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart-fx):

Background
----------
The code has been developed for the use of **Orson Charts** (https://github.com/jfree/orson-charts/) 
and **JFreeChart** (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart).  Numerous demos can be
found in the [JFree-FXDemos](https://github.com/jfree/jfree-fxdemos "JFree-FXDemos Project Page at GitHub")
project page at GitHub.

You can also read about *FXGraphics2D* in this Java Magazine article:

*FXGraphics2D* requires JDK 11 or later and is licensed under the terms of a (three clause) BSD-style license.


Include
-------
To include `FXGraphics2D` in your own project, add the following Maven dependency:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.jfree</groupId>
        <artifactId>org.jfree.fxgraphics2d</artifactId>
        <version>2.1.5</version>
    </dependency>

Build
-----
You can build `FXGraphics2D` from sources using Maven:

    mvn clean install

Testing
-------
FXGraphics2D is being tested using [Graphics2D Tester](https://github.com/jfree/graphics2d-tester) and produces the output shown below.  There are several areas that still need work:

- the compositing rules in `AlphaComposite` cannot be mapped 100% to JavaFX equivalents
- font metrics are approximated
- image drawing with clipping shows a strange greying out effect
- `TexturePaint` is not supported yet (but see [pull request #14](https://github.com/jfree/fxgraphics2d/pull/14))
